	'## Privacy\r\n\r\n> Last updated: Sep 15, 2025\r\n\r\nBasics:\r\n\r\n- Sign-in: You authenticate with your Hugging Face account.\r\n- Conversation history: Stored so you can access past chats; you can delete any conversation at any time from the UI.\r\n\r\n🗓 Please also consult huggingface.co\'s main privacy policy at <https://huggingface.co/privacy>. To exercise any of your legal privacy rights, please send an email to <privacy@huggingface.co>.\r\n\r\n## Data handling and processing\r\n\r\nHuggingChat uses Hugging Face’s Inference Providers to access models from multiple partners via a single API. Depending on the model and availability, inference runs with the corresponding provider.\r\n\r\n- Inference Providers documentation: <https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers>\r\n- Security & Compliance: <https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/security>\r\n\r\nSecurity and routing facts\r\n\r\n- Hugging Face does not store any user data for training purposes.\r\n- Hugging Face does not store the request body or the response when routing requests through Hugging Face.\r\n- Logs are kept for debugging purposes for up to 30 days, but no user data or tokens are stored in those logs.\r\n- Inference Provider routing uses TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit.\r\n- The Hugging Face Hub (which Inference Providers is a feature of) is SOC 2 Type 2 certified. See <https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security>.\r\n\r\nExternal providers are responsible for their own security and data handling. Please consult each provider’s respective security and privacy policies via the Inference Providers documentation linked above.\r\n\r\n## Technical details\r\n\r\n[![chat-ui](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/huggingface/chat-ui)](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui)\r\n\r\nThe app is completely open source, and further development takes place on the [huggingface/chat-ui](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui) GitHub repo. We\'re always open to contributions!\r\n\r\nYou can find the production configuration for HuggingChat [here](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui/blob/main/chart/env/prod.yaml).\r\n\r\nHuggingChat connects to the OpenAI‑compatible Inference Providers router at `https://router.huggingface.co/v1` to access models across multiple providers. Provider selection may be automatic or fixed depending on the model configuration.\r\n\r\nWe welcome any feedback on this app: please participate in the public discussion at <https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingchat/chat-ui/discussions>\r\n\r\n<a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingchat/chat-ui/discussions"><img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/raw/main/open-a-discussion-xl.svg" title="open a discussion"></a>\r\n';
